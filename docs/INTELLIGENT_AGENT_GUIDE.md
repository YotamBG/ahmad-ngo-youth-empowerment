# 🤖 Intelligent WhatsApp Agent Guide

**AI-Powered WhatsApp automation with three intelligent action modes**

## 🎯 Overview

This advanced system uses OpenAI's Agent SDK to intelligently analyze your WhatsApp messages and decide between three action modes:

1. **💬 Respond in WhatsApp** - Direct AI-generated responses
2. **📝 Execute on Cursor** - Send commands to your code editor
3. **👁️ Observe & Control** - Take screenshots, analyze with AI, control your screen

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

```bash
# Install required packages
pip3 install openai selenium selenium-stealth webdriver-manager pyautogui opencv-python pillow pygetwindow keyboard

# Set OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key-here'
```

### 2. Launch the Agent

```bash
# From project root
python3 start_intelligent_agent.py
```

### 3. First-Time Setup

1. **Chrome opens** to WhatsApp Web
2. **Scan QR code** with your phone
3. **Agent starts monitoring** for messages from `052 339 6883`

## 🧠 How AI Decision Making Works

The agent uses **GPT-4** to analyze every message and decide the best action:

### 🔍 Decision Process

```
Message: "Check my screen"
↓
AI Analysis: "User wants screen observation"
↓
Decision: OBSERVE_CONTROL
↓
Action: Take screenshot → Analyze with AI → Report findings
```

### 📋 Decision Criteria

| Message Type | AI Decision | Action Taken |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| Questions, greetings, info requests | `RESPOND_WHATSAPP` | Direct AI response |
| "code", "cursor", "edit", "programming" | `EXECUTE_CURSOR` | Send to Cursor editor |
| "check", "screen", "observe", "control" | `OBSERVE_CONTROL` | Screen automation |

## 💬 Action Mode 1: Respond in WhatsApp

**When:** Questions, conversations, information requests

### Examples:
```
You: "How's the website doing?"
Bot: 🤖 The website has a 96.8% success rate with perfect design and functionality scores. Only the domain needs nameserver configuration.

You: "What's the weather like?"
Bot: 🤖 I can help with website and development tasks, but I don't have access to weather information. Is there anything coding-related I can assist with?
```

### Features:
- **Intelligent responses** using GPT-4
- **Context-aware** conversations
- **Concise WhatsApp-friendly** format
- **Professional tone** with emojis

## 📝 Action Mode 2: Execute on Cursor

**When:** Code editing, programming tasks, Cursor commands

### Examples:
```
You: "Open new file in cursor"
Bot: ✅ Executed in Cursor: Open new file in cursor
Action: Opens new file (Ctrl+N)

You: "Save the current file"
Bot: ✅ Executed in Cursor: Save the current file  
Action: Saves file (Ctrl+S)

You: "Open terminal in cursor"
Bot: ✅ Executed in Cursor: Open terminal in cursor
Action: Opens terminal (Ctrl+`)
```

### Supported Commands:
- **File operations**: "new file", "open file", "save"
- **Navigation**: "find", "search", "command palette"
- **Tools**: "terminal", "console"
- **Custom code**: AI interprets and types commands

### Features:
- **Automatic Cursor detection** and focus
- **Smart command interpretation** by AI
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for common actions
- **Direct text input** for complex commands

## 👁️ Action Mode 3: Observe & Control

**When:** Screen analysis, automation tasks, visual inspection

### Examples:
```
You: "Check my screen"
Bot: 👁️ Screen Analysis:
I can see a Cursor editor with a Python file open. The code appears to be a WhatsApp automation script. There are no visible errors and the file structure looks organized...

You: "Click on the terminal tab"
Bot: 👁️ Screen Analysis: Found terminal tab in the interface
🎯 Actions completed!
Result: Successfully clicked on terminal tab. Terminal is now active and ready for commands...
```

### Capabilities:
- **Screenshot capture** with timestamp
- **AI visual analysis** using GPT-4 Vision
- **Smart click/type actions** based on analysis
- **Screen automation** with feedback
- **Before/after comparison**

### Screen Actions:
- **Click** coordinates determined by AI
- **Type** text where AI determines appropriate
- **Scroll** up/down based on content
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for system control
- **Multi-step automation** sequences

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Context Understanding

The AI maintains context and can handle complex requests:

```
You: "The code has a bug in line 45, fix it"
→ AI: EXECUTE_CURSOR + navigate to line 45 + analyze + suggest fix

You: "Take a screenshot and tell me what's wrong"
→ AI: OBSERVE_CONTROL + screenshot + detailed analysis + recommendations
```

### 🎯 Smart Action Chaining

For complex tasks, the AI can chain multiple actions:

1. **Screen analysis** → **Cursor command** → **Verification**
2. **Code editing** → **Save** → **Screenshot** → **Report**

### 🔒 Safety Features

- **Failsafe enabled** - Move mouse to corner to stop
- **Command validation** - AI checks before dangerous actions
- **Timeout protection** - Prevents infinite loops
- **Error handling** - Graceful failure with user notification

## 📱 Command Examples

### Basic Responses
```
"Hello" → Friendly AI greeting
"Status" → System status report
"Help" → Available commands and features
```

### Cursor Commands
```
"New Python file" → Creates new .py file
"Format code" → Runs code formatter
"Find TODO comments" → Searches for TODO
"Open project settings" → Opens settings panel
```

### Screen Control
```
"What's on my screen?" → Screenshot + analysis
"Click the run button" → Finds and clicks run
"Type 'hello world'" → Types text at cursor
"Scroll down to see more" → Scrolls page down
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
export WHATSAPP_TARGET='052 339 6883'  # Optional: change target number
```

### Config File: `scripts/config/settings.yaml`
```yaml
whatsapp:
  target_number: "052 339 6883"
  check_interval: 3

openai:
  model: "gpt-4"
  vision_model: "gpt-4-vision-preview"
  max_tokens: 200

screen:
  screenshot_dir: "screenshots"
  fail_safe: true
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### AI Decision Making
```bash
# If AI makes wrong decisions:
# 1. Be more specific in messages
# 2. Use keywords like "cursor", "screen", "respond"
# 3. Check OpenAI API key and usage
```

#### Cursor Integration
```bash
# If Cursor commands don't work:
# 1. Make sure Cursor is installed and accessible
# 2. Try opening Cursor manually first
# 3. Check pygetwindow can find windows
```

#### Screen Control
```bash
# If screen automation fails:
# 1. Check display permissions on Linux
# 2. Ensure pyautogui can control mouse/keyboard  
# 3. Try disabling fail-safe temporarily
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Run with debug output
PYTHONPATH=scripts python3 -c "
from intelligent_whatsapp_agent import IntelligentWhatsAppAgent
agent = IntelligentWhatsAppAgent()
# Test individual components
"
```

## 📊 Performance

- **Decision latency**: ~2-3 seconds (OpenAI API call)
- **Screen analysis**: ~5-10 seconds (screenshot + vision)
- **Cursor commands**: ~1 second (local automation)
- **Memory usage**: ~100-200MB (Chrome + Python)

## 🔐 Security

- **Number filtering**: Only processes messages from your number
- **API isolation**: OpenAI calls are isolated
- **Screen access**: Local only, no data transmitted
- **Session privacy**: WhatsApp session saved locally

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Send test message**: "Hello" to verify basic response
2. **Try Cursor**: "Open new file in cursor" 
3. **Test screen control**: "Take a screenshot"
4. **Advanced usage**: "Check my code for errors and fix them"
