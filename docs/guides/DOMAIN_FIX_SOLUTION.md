## üí° **IMPORTANT NOTES**

- **This is the ONLY way** to fix the domain issue
- **No Vercel CLI commands** can fix this - it must be done at the registrar
- **The domain WILL NOT WORK** until nameservers are changed
- **All other website functionality** is working correctly
- **After this fix**, the domain will work exactly like `matrix-dance.com`

---

## üéØ **BOTTOM LINE**

**The domain `arabyouthleaders.org` is properly configured in Vercel but the nameservers at your domain registrar are not pointing to Vercel. You must log in to where you bought the domain and change the nameservers to Vercel's nameservers. This is the ONLY solution that will fix the issue.**
